2. Revenue and sales quantity performance at market level.

3. Revenue Trend since the inception of the company

4. The project also shows profit% and profit% contribution for the customer,markets. It also displays Total revenue and revenue contribution for each customer as well.

5. To get a more in-depth Sales analysis the project also shows the overall profit% at three levels. Zone -> Markets -> Products. After seeing this chart the business owners will be able to take future course of action easily.
